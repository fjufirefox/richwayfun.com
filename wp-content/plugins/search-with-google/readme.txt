Replace WordPress default search with server-side rendered Google Custom Search results.

== Description ==

This plugin will replace the WordPress default search query with server-side results from [Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api). This replacement is done on the WordPress back-end, so results appear as normal within WordPress search.

= Requirements =
1. [Google API Key](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
1. [Programmable Search engine ID](https://cse.google.com/all)

= Setup =
1. [Get Google API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction). An API key is a way to identify your client to Google.
1. [Get Programmable Search engine ID](https://cse.google.com/). In Google settings, restrict the Search engine to only search for your one site.
1. On WordPress dashboard, set API Key and Custom Search Engine ID in the plugin settings. `Dashboard > Settings > Reading > Search with Google Settings`.

= Notes =
1. Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API can show only 100 search results for the query.
1. A result page can have maximum of 10 results.
